    <string name="welcome_to_paper">Welcome to Paper Telephone, a fun and multiplayer drawing game. This game involves three steps: draw an image based on a word, pass the device to the next person, and guess the original word associated with the drawing. To begin playing, select the New Game button on the home screen.</string>
    <string name="a_canvas_to_draw">A canvas to draw should now be displayed on the screen. Pick any word or phrase that comes to your mind, and create a drawing by touching the screen with your finger. Once finished, pass the device to the next person in the group. This person will now try to guess the word/phrase that the drawing is based on. Once a guess has been made, pass the device to the next person and create a drawing based on the guess of the previous person.</string>
